    The Distance Machine logs some information about people's use of the site.  This includes the titles of the texts uploaded and their lengths (measured in characters, words, and lines), the time when they were uploaded, the amount of time they took to process, and statistics about the results of the algorithm.  We use these data primarily to make sure that the algorithm is working well with all of the texts that people are trying out.  The Distance Machine does not presently log the IP addresses of uploaders.

    Unsaved texts are deleted from the server within a few hours after the browser window is closed.  If you save a text, it will remain on the server indefinitely; however, there will be no way for other users to find the text unless you send them a link.  If you'd like us to remove a text that you have saved, please contact <a href="mailto:jbinder@gc.cuny.edu">Jeffrey Binder</a>.
